This short sad love story definitely revels upon the same. It is sometimes needed to take risks and let out your feelings as unsaid love is much more painful than unrequited love. So, grab your chance and tell that special person how much you love them!",UIImage(named: "profile5"), 11, 78, 23, false),

        FacebookPost(UIImage(named: "profile4")!, "Meas Marina", "2hr", "Singapor", "In this world of virtual reality, the scenario of love and relationships has turned false.
